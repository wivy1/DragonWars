## Description
DragonWars is a turn-based aerial combat miniatures game, inspired by convention-style wargames. It emphasizes precise movement, quick play, and genuine vertical height. Players control a set of dragon units, each with its own movement and combat capabilities, in a race to capture a central objective or simply outmaneuver and outlast opposing dragons.

## Features
- **Fully 3D-printable** - everything is 3D-printable on a standard Ender-3 size FDM printer
- **2-6 Players**
- **4 Dragon Types:** Four distinct units (Wyrmling, Drake, Elder, Ancient) each with unique speed, size, and combat abilities.

  - **Telescoping Risers** – Modular pieces that stack, can rotate in discrete increments, and can telescope in increments up to a height of 7

- **3 Game Modes:** 
  - **Capture the Egg** – A race to retrieve the dragon egg from the summit of the mountain and return it to your lair.
  - **Deathmatch** – A fight to the death, destroy all enemies and be the last dragon standing. 
  - **Colors vs Chromatics** – A team-based deathmatch variant where colored dragons and metallic dragons face off.
- **Customizable 3D Terrain** A modular hex system supports custom 3D map layouts. Optional chipboard terrain pieces (via laser-cutting or similar approach) for maximum visual appeal.

## How to Play
1. **Set Up the Board and Lairs:** Arrange hex-based terrain. Each player places their four dragons (Wyrmling, Drake, Elder, Ancient) in their designated lair hexes.  
2. **Plot Actions:** Each Round consists of three Turns. Players simultaneously and secretly plot movement and combat for all three Turns on their plotting boards.  
3. **Resolve Movement and Combat:**
   - **Movement:** Once plotting boards are revealed, execute each dragon’s plotted moves. Track height changes using the riser system or carbon rods. Illegal moves (e.g., crashing into terrain) may cause a dragon to fall and take damage.  
   - **Combat:** After movement, all valid plotted combat actions are resolved. Dragons sharing a hex at the same height may also engage in melee attacks.  
4. **Victory Conditions:** Vary by mode.
   - **Capture the Egg** – Retrieve the egg token from the summit and return it to your lair.  
   - **Deathmatch** – Eliminate all other players’ dragons.  
   - **Colors vs Chromatics** –  Eliminate all other team's dragons.
